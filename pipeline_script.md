# Jenkins Pipeline for Building and Deploying Dockerized Application

This Markdown guide provides a Jenkins Pipeline script designed to automate the build, test, and deployment process of a Dockerized application to Docker Hub. Each stage in the pipeline is explained below.

```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any

    stages {
        stage('Checkout') {
            steps {
                // Checkout the source code from the repository
                checkout scmGit(branches: [[name: '*/main']], extensions: [], userRemoteConfigs: [[url: 'https://github.com/sohitdeveloper/todo-app-react.git']])
            }
        }

        stage('Test') {
            steps {
                // Run tests (placeholder)
                echo "Running tests..."
            }
        }

        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                // Build the Docker image
                script {
                    sh "docker build -t imgName ."
                }
            }
        }

        stage('Deploy to Docker Hub') {
            steps {
                // Deploy the Docker container to Docker Hub
                script {
                    def dockerImageTag = "imgName:latest"
                    def dockerHubImageTag = "user/imgName:latest"
                    
                    // Log in to Docker Hub
                    sh "docker login -u username -p password"
                    
                    // Tag and push the Docker image to Docker Hub
                    sh "docker tag ${dockerImageTag} ${dockerHubImageTag}"
                    sh "docker push ${dockerHubImageTag}"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Stage Explanations:

1. **Checkout:**
   - This stage checks out the source code from the specified Git repository (https://github.com/sohitdeveloper/todo-app-react.git).
   - The code is retrieved from the `main` branch.

2. **Test:**
   - Placeholder stage to run tests. Currently, it uses `echo` to indicate that tests are being run.

3. **Build:**
   - In this stage, the Docker image is built using the Dockerfile located in the repository.
   - The built image is tagged with the name `todoapp`.

4. **Deploy to Docker Hub:**
   - In this final stage, the Docker image is deployed to Docker Hub.
   - The `dockerImageTag` is set to `todoapp:latest`, representing the local Docker image.
   - The `dockerHubImageTag` is set to `sohit28/todoapp:latest`, representing the Docker Hub image.
   - The script first logs in to Docker Hub using the provided credentials.
   - The local Docker image is tagged with the Docker Hub image tag.
   - Finally, the image is pushed to Docker Hub.

This Jenkins Pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying a Dockerized application to Docker Hub. You can customize each stage according to your application's requirements.
