# Setting Up Docker on Ubuntu

This Markdown guide explains the steps to set up Docker on an Ubuntu machine. Docker is a platform used for containerization, enabling the efficient packaging and deployment of applications.

## Step 1: Update APT Package Index and Install Dependencies
```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ca-certificates curl gnupg
```
First, update the APT package index to get the latest package information. Then, install the required dependencies that allow APT to use repositories over HTTPS.

## Step 2: Add Docker's Official GPG Key
```bash
sudo install -m 0755 -d /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
sudo chmod a+r /etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg
```
This step adds Docker's official GPG key to ensure the authenticity of Docker packages.

## Step 3: Set Up Docker Repository
```bash
echo \
  "deb [arch=\"$(dpkg --print-architecture)\" signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  \"$(. /etc/os-release && echo \"$VERSION_CODENAME\")\" stable" | \
  sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```
Add the Docker repository to the APT sources list. This provides access to Docker packages for installation.

**Note:** If you're using an Ubuntu derivative distro like Linux Mint, replace `VERSION_CODENAME` with `UBUNTU_CODENAME`.

## Step 4: Update APT Package Index Again
```bash
sudo apt-get update
```
Update the APT package index again to include the newly added Docker repository.

## Step 5: Install Docker Engine, containerd, and Docker Compose
```bash
sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin
```
Install Docker Engine, containerd (an industry-standard core container runtime), Docker Compose (a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications), and additional Docker plugins.

## Step 6: Verify Docker Installation
```bash
sudo docker run hello-world
```
Verify the successful installation of Docker by running the `hello-world` image. This command downloads a test image and runs it in a container. If Docker is properly installed, a confirmation message will be printed, and the container will exit.

After completing these steps, Docker should be successfully set up on your Ubuntu machine. You can now proceed to use Docker to manage and deploy containerized applications.
